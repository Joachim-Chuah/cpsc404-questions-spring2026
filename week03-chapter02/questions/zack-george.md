## Question

Last class, as well as in Chapter 1, we talked about how the key to becoming a highly trusted team member, you need to constantly present yourself as completely capable of all tasks presented, and omit any possible concerns you have about your ability to complete a task. Chapter 2 reneged on this idea, saying that the best answer to give is an honest one that clearly establishes the current bounds of your knowledge. Personally, this feels much more natural and generally condusive to a healthy working environment. Why should we treat work assignments any different, and instead approach all situations by default with a level of 'radical honesty'?
